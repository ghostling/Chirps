# Overview
Chirps is a mobile announcement-type application. There is an existing system called Chirps on Pomona College, where students submit announcements, or "chirps", by email or through a web form for the Chirps administrator to approve or reject. The administrator manually generates a weekly email containing the approved Chirps while loosely categorized by preset categories like social, academic, and for-sale listings. Students have to read through the whole email to see what chirps are relevant to their interests and there's no easy way to keep track of the Chirps that you're interested in. This is **no good**! Students deserve *better*, so this is how the Chirps mobile application came to be. Our application aims to provide the same functionality, but *more*.

Current Release
-----
The project is currently in the development phase, set for release on December 9, 2014.

Why use Chirps?
-----
Haven't you ever wanted to send an announcement to your fellow students without spamming their email? Haven't you ever wanted to see what was going around on campus, without looking at your email? If so, Chirps is here for *you*, unless you are not a student of the Claremont Colleges. As of now, Chirps is only available at the five Claremont Colleges in Claremont, CA. 

Current Features
-----
1. Use Chirps to **send** chirps to all students on specific campuses, as well as **receive** chirps.
2. Rather than wait for a weekly email, these chirps will be available for students as soon as an administrator approves it! 
3. Filter active chirps by preset categories such as social, academic, speaker, workshop, and more. 
4. Follow specific chirps and get notifications of when the event is approaching. 
5. Search for active chirps by keyword.
6. Get notifications when your submitted chirps get approved or rejected.
7. Your list of chirps will not get overwhelmed - chirps will all expire when they are no longer relevant.

I love it! How do I get Chirps?
-----
You can download Chirps on the Android Play Store after December 9th, 2014. There are no plans currently for an iOS and Windows Phone version.

To use Chirps, you will need a valid email at one of the five Claremont Colleges.
